# Exercises signature

This plugin allows the teacher to check a box in any exercise configuration to request a signature from the user at the end of the exercise attempt.

A modal window, a bit like a mini-whiteboard, will then appear to students asking them to sign. The signature can be done through the mouse (unpractical), through a touch device (ideal with tablets) or through a touch-sensitive laptop screen.

Teachers will see the signature when they review the attempt details.

## Installation

This plugin creates extra fields for exercises automatically.

Signatures are saved as a drawing in the database.

Uninstalling this plugin will remove the extra fields, so all signatures will disappear (instantly) if you uninstall this. Consider using the "disable" option inside the plugin configuration instead.
