Resubscription
==============

Limit session re-subscriptions by checking whether the user was already 
subscribed to a specific course *through a session* over the last 12 
months or the last calendar year (from 1st of January to 31st of December).

This plugin does not support sessions by "duration" at this time, so the
date of last access is based on the session's access_end_date field, which
defines when student access is removed (not the "display" end date, which
is the date that shows in the session's public details).
