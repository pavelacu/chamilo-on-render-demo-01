Before login plugin
===

This plugins shows a page before showing the login page. It is a bit rough and requires theming work to make anything appealing.

This is useful if you want to ask a question before a user has the opportunity to login.

Example:
You're old enough to enter this site? If you accept the "option 1" then you can enter to the campus (the login will appear).

If you select "option 2" then you're redirected to another page.

To enable, install the plugin then add it to the content_top or main_top region.
Theme it by creating custom.template.tpl from template.tpl in the plugin/before_login/ directory.
